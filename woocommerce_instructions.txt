These instructions are for creating tickets in the woocommerce shop the correct way.

step 1:
  go to woocommerce and add a SIMPLE PRODUCT

step 2:
  set properties:  {virtual:true,downloadable:false}

--------------------
now orders will be in 'wp_posts' database with post_type='shop_order'

post_status='wc_processing'



now the service can pick up that order and set status to 'wc-completed'

for processing the order it
uses the ID column in wp_posts
to get the info in wp_postmeta by getting the rows where post_id=ID

meta_key can be _billing_first_name, _billing_last_name, _billing_email
